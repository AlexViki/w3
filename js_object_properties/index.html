			<h1>JS Object Properties</h1>
			<p id="inner-header">Properties are the most important part of any JavaScript object.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="main">
			<div class="block-1">
				<h2>JavaScript Properties</h2>
				<p>Properties are the values associated with a JavaScript object. <br>
				A JavaScript object is a collection of unordered properties.<br>
				Properties can usually be changed, added, and deleted, but some are read only.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="bl2" class="block-1">
				<h2>Accessing JavaScript Properties</h2>
				<p>The syntax for accessing the property of an object is:</p>
				<code>objectName.property // person.age</code>
				<code>objectName["property"] // person["age"]</code>
				<code>objectName[expression] // x = "age"; person[x]</code>
				<p class="important-info">The expression must evaluate to a property name.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="bl3" class="block-1">
				<h2>JavaScript for...in Loop</h2>
				<p>The JavaScript for...in statement loops through the properties of an object.</p>
				<p>The block of code inside of the for...in loop will be executed once for each property.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="bl4" class="block-1">
				<h2>Adding New Properties</h2>
				<p>You can add new properties to an existing object by simply giving it a value.</p>
				<p>Assume that the person object already exists - you can then give it new propertie</p>
			</div>
			<div id="bl5" class="block-1">
				<h2>Deleting Properties</h2>
				<p>The delete keyword deletes both the value of the property and the property itself.</p>
				<p>After deletion, the property cannot be used before it is added back again.</p>
				<p>The delete operator is designed to be used on object properties. It has <b>no effect</b> on variables or functions.</p>
				<p>The delete operator should not be used on predefined JavaScript object properties. It can crash your application.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="block-1">Property Attributes</div>
			<p>All properties have a name. In addition they also have a value.</p>
			<p>The value is one of the property's attributes.</p>
			<p>Other attributes are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>enumerable</li>
				<li>configurable</li>
				<li>writable</li>
			</ul>
			<P>These attributes define how the property can be accessed (is it readable?, is it writable?)</P>
			<p>In JavaScript, all attributes can be read, but only the value attribute can be changed (and only if the property is writable).</p>
			<p>( ECMAScript 5 has methods for both getting and setting all property attributes)</p>
		</div>
		<div class="block-1">Prototype Properties</div>
		<p>JavaScript objects inherit the properties of their prototype.</p>
		<p>The delete keyword does not delete inherited properties, but if you delete a prototype property, it will affect all objects inherited from the prototype.</p>
	</div>
