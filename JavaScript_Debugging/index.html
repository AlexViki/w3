            <h2>Code Debugging</h2>
            <p>Programming code might contain syntax errors, or logical errors. Many of these errors are difficult to diagnose. <br>
            Often, when programming code contains errors, nothing will happen. There are no error messages, and you will get no indications where to search for errors. <br>
            Searching for (and fixing) errors in programming code is called code debugging.</p>

            <h2>JavaScript Debuggers</h2>
            <p>Debugging is not easy. But fortunately, all modern browsers have a built-in JavaScript debugger. <br>
            Built-in debuggers can be turned on and off, forcing errors to be reported to the user. <br>
            With a debugger, you can also set breakpoints (places where code execution can be stopped), and examine variables while the code is executing. <br>
            Normally, otherwise follow the steps at the bottom of this page, you activate debugging in your browser with the F12 key, and select "Console" in the debugger menu.</p>

        <div class="block-1">
            <h2>Setting Breakpoints</h2>
            <p>In the debugger window, you can set breakpoints in the JavaScript code. <br> At each breakpoint, JavaScript will stop executing, and let you examine JavaScript values. <br>After examining values, you can resume the execution of code (typically with a play button)</p>

        <div class="block-1">
            <h2>The debugger Keyword</h2>
            <p>The debugger keyword stops the execution of JavaScript, and calls (if available) the debugging function. <br>
            This has the same function as setting a breakpoint in the debugger. If no debugging is available, the debugger statement has no effect. </p>
