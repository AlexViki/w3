			<h1>JS Function Definitions</h1>
			<p id="inner-header">JavaScript functions are defined with the function keyword.<br>
			You can use a function declaration or a function expression.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="main">
			<div class="block-1">
				<h2>Function Declarations</h2>
				<p>functions are declared with the following syntax:</p>
				<code>
					function functionName(parameters) {<br>
					code to be executed<br>
					}
				</code>
				<p>Declared functions are not executed immediately. They are "saved for later use", and will be executed later, when they are invoked (called upon).</p>
				<p id="id_1"></p>
				<p class="important-info">Semicolons are used to separate executable JavaScript statements.<br>
				Since a function declaration is not an executable statement, it is not common to end it with a semicolon.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="block-1">
				<h2>Function Expressions</h2>
				<p>A JavaScript function can also be defined using an expression.</p>
				<p>A function expression can be stored in a variable.</p>
				<p id="id_2"></p>
				<p>Functions stored in variables do not need function names. They are always invoked (called) using the variable name.</p>
				<p class="important-info">The function above ends with a semicolon because it is a part of an executable statement.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="block-1">
				<h2>The Function() Constructor</h2>
				<p>As you have seen in the previous examples, JavaScript functions are defined with the <b>function keyword</b>.</p>
				<p>Functions can also be defined with a built-in JavaScript function constructor called Function().</p>
				<p>You actually don't have to use the function constructor.</p>
				<p class="important-info">Most of the time, you can avoid using the new keyword in JavaScript.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="block-1">
				<h2>Function Hoisting</h2>
				<p>Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top of the current scope.</p>
				<p>Hoisting applies to variable declarations and to function declarations.</p>
				<p>Because of this, JavaScript functions can be called before they are declared:</p>
				<code>
				myFunction(5);<br><br>

				function myFunction(y) {<br>
    			return y * y;<br>
				}

				</code>
				<p>Functions defined using an expression are not hoisted.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="block-1">
				<h2>Self-Invoking Functions</h2>
				<p>Function expressions can be made "self-invoking".</p>
				<p>A self-invoking expression is invoked (started) automatically, without being called.</p>
				<p>Function expressions will execute automatically if the expression is followed by ().</p>
				<p>You have to <b>add parentheses around the function</b> to indicate that it is a function expression</p>
				<button id="btn5">RUN</button>
				<p id="id_5"></p>
				<p class="important-info">You cannot self-invoke a function declaration.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="block-1">
				<h2>Functions Can Be Used as Values</h2>
				<p id="id_6"></p>
			</div>
			<div class="block-1">
				<h2>Functions are Objects</h2>
				<p>The typeof operator in JavaScript returns "function" for functions.</p>
				<p>But, JavaScript functions can best be described as objects.</p>
				<p>JavaScript functions have both properties and methods.</p>
				<p>The arguments.length property returns the number of arguments received when the function was invoked</p>
				<p id="id_7"></p>
				<p class="important-info">
					A function defined as the property of an object, is called a method to the object.<br>
					A function designed to create new objects, is called an object constructor.
